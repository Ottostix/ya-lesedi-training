## Critical Issues Found

### üî¥ **CRITICAL BUG #1: Dashboard Navigation Buttons Not Working**

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Users cannot access any feature pages from the dashboard

**Description:** The Quick Action buttons on the dashboard respond to clicks but do not navigate to their target pages. The wouter navigation code (`setLocation()`) is not being executed.

**Evidence:**
- Buttons show hover effects when clicked
- URL does not change after clicking
- No error messages in console
- Page remains on /dashboard

**Likely Cause:** The production deployment is running an older version of the code that doesn't include the navigation fixes. The GitHub push failed earlier, so the updated Dashboard.tsx with wouter navigation was never deployed.

**Fix Required:** Force a new Vercel deployment with the latest code that includes the working navigation implementation.

---

### üî¥ **CRITICAL BUG #2: Feature Pages Fail to Load**

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Even when navigating directly to feature pages via URL, they fail to load

**Description:** Attempting to navigate directly to /users results in an infinite "Loading..." state with HTTP/2 protocol errors.

**Evidence:**
- Page displays "Loading..." indefinitely
- HTTP/2 protocol errors in browser console
- Resources fail to load with `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`

**Likely Cause:** The feature pages (Users, Quizzes, Menus, Stores) may not be fully implemented or have missing dependencies/components that are causing load failures.

**Fix Required:** Implement complete feature pages with proper error handling and ensure all dependencies are available.

---

### üü° **ISSUE #3: Environment Variables Not Configured**

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** AI features disabled, app title not displaying correctly

**Description:** 
- OpenAI API key not configured (Quiz generation disabled)
- VITE_APP_TITLE showing as "%VITE_APP_TITLE%" in browser title
- Environment variables may not be properly injected

**Evidence:**
- Browser console warning: "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Page title shows "%VITE_APP_TITLE%" instead of "Ya Lesedi Restaurant Training System"

**Fix Required:** Configure environment variables in Vercel project settings.
